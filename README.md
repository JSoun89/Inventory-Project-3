# Inventory-Project-3
1.Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
  A simple way designed for businesses that want to seamlessly track and edit inventory. Inventory is able to be edited by adding, viewing, updating, and updating the material. The application is updating in real time when the user inputs new data. The user is also able to sign up for SMS which allows them to get notification if the stock level runs too low. The apps is designed to be clean and simple because a busy inventory database could cause issues. For example, displaying too much information with a lot of data could make the system run slower and be overwhelming for the user. Therefore, I chose purple and white because the login and creating account button will stand out. However, it is not too overwhelming with designs and colors.

2.What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
  The screens that were needed to suport the application is login, inventory, edit screen. Having different screens allows for the user to use the application more efficiently. Having the app organized and not have too many colors and text allows the user to focus on the necessity rather than getting distracted. 

3.How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?
  Techniques that I used to process the code is breaking down the task into multiple smaller ones. By doing so allows me to focus on the task at hand rather than getting overwhelmed with the whole project. This allows me to catch errors faster and helps me stay organized. 
  
4.How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?
  There was a lot of testing that goes into ensuring that the application was functional. One of the biggest problems faced was the zip file not opening accruatly. Therefore, I went back and tried reopening the application along with testing it again. Running the debug also helped with finding errors like syntax issues. 
  
5.Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
  One of the challenges I faced was using Android Studio. After playing around with the application for other projects I was able to understand and use it more efficently. Having more practice and getting comfortable without any pressure of a grade a great way to overcome my challenge. 

6.In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
  I believe the SMS permission was out of my comfort zone. I understand the importance of utilizing the SMS notification for things like low stock notifications. Therefore, I think it was great that I learned this for future reference on different projects!
